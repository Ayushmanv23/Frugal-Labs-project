# Shine Job Automation 🚀

This project automates job application tasks on [Shine.com](https://www.shine.com) using Selenium WebDriver with Java.

It logs in with your Shine credentials, performs a job search based on your preferences, selects a listing, and applies automatically — simulating human-like interaction and handling pop-ups dynamically.
